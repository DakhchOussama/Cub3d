# Ray-casting vs Ray-tracing with Cub3D

🚀 **Ray-casting**: a rendering technique for creating a 3D perspective in a 2D map.

🌐 **Ray-tracing**: a lighting technique that brings realism to games by emulating real-world light reflection and refraction.

## Ray-casting vs Ray-tracing:

**Ray-casting:**
- Rays are cast and traced in groups.
- In a 320x200 display resolution, a ray-caster traces only 320 rays.
- Fast rendering but less realistic.
- Viable for real-time rendering.

**Ray-Tracing:**
- Each ray is traced separately, one per pixel.
- In a 320x200 display resolution, a ray-tracer needs to trace 64,000 rays.
- Slow rendering but highly realistic.
- Not viable for real-time rendering.

## Ray-casting Limitations:

- Walls are always perpendicular (90-degree angle) to the floor.
- Floor is always flat.
- Walls are made of cubes with the same size (square grid only).

# Trigonometry:

**Degrees and Radians:**
- Degrees range from 0 to 360.
- Radians are a pure measure based on the radius of the circle.
- 1 radian = 57.2958 degrees.

## Controls:

🎮 **Game Controls:**
- Use arrow keys for movement.
- Rotate the view using the left and right arrow keys.
- Interact with objects using a specified key (e.g., spacebar).

🕹️ **Customization:**
- You can customize controls by modifying the configuration file.
- Refer to the documentation for details on configuration options.
